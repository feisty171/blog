<p>Because, in a way, it takes immense resolve to face that kind of finality. To look at life, at everything it holds, and decide to just step away from it. It is not an easy decision to say, “I am going to end my life,” and actually follow through.</p>

<p>There was a time I even quietly mocked myself for not having the courage to commit to it. I thought, I don’t have the courage to face life, nor the courage to face death either. What does that make me?
But I’m glad I stayed. It made me realise that most of us who speak of wanting to die, are just crying out for a reason to stay. And I’m grateful we found one, even if it was just enough to make it through another day.</p>

<p>Because even in that unfathomable pain, exhaustion, and thick fog of despair, we are choosing courage.</p>

<p>The courage to live life.
To live is to stand in the fire of your own thoughts and still refuse to burn. It is to wake up every day carrying the same heaviness, the same fears, the same uncertainty, and still move, even if only an inch.</p>

<p>To live is to face the weight of being an imperfect human: the loneliness, the disappointments, the quiet doubts that whisper nothing will ever change, or worse, you would be better off gone.
And yet, somehow, we move on anyway.
We get up.
We brush our teeth.
We go to work.
We laugh at something small.
We make plans for a tomorrow we are not even sure we believe in.
That is courage.
Not the kind that is visible or celebrated, but the kind that exists quietly and stubbornly in the background of even our worst days.</p>

<p>The courage to live is not made of grand gestures.
It is built from small acts of persistence, the strength to not give up, to try again, to keep breathing even when your chest feels tight.</p>

<p>It is cooking yourself a meal when you have no appetite.
It is sending a message because some part of you still wants connection.
It is saying yes to another sunrise, even when you do not know why.</p>

<p>Living takes courage because it means saying yes in the face of uncertainty.
It means saying yes to pain, to grief, to loss, and trusting that somewhere in that mess, there can still be light.
It is a quiet act of faith, repeated again and again, even when life feels impossible.</p>

<p>There is no finish line to this kind of courage.
No medal. No applause.
Just the quiet, relentless courage of choosing life, over and over, especially on the days where hope feels out of reach.</p>

<p>And maybe that is what makes it so extraordinary.
Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is simply have the courage to live.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to believe that people who went through with suicide were the most courageous ones.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Letter To My Future Self</title><link href="https://hofeiying.com/A-Letter-To-My-Future-Self/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Letter To My Future Self" /><published>2025-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hofeiying.com/A-Letter-To-My-Future-Self</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofeiying.com/A-Letter-To-My-Future-Self/"><![CDATA[<p>Hey you, how are you feeling right now, please be honest. I hope you’re doing well, that life is going steady and that your days have some light in them. But even if they don’t, I want you to pause and breathe. Because you’ll realise that everything will be okay just like they always do. You’ve been through enough storms to know that no weather, no matter how brutal, lasts forever. Let me remind you of where you came from.</p>

<p>You were born into a world that didn’t exactly offer a gentle welcome. The family you were born into left you with wounds. Some obvious, some invisible. You didn’t have an option, but you carried them through your childhood, teenagehood and ultimately adulthood anyway. You experienced the confusion, the loneliness, the yearning to be seen and loved without condition. Those open wounds didn’t just hurt. They shaped the way you trusted, the way you connected, the way you viewed yourself. You were like an empty rotting carcass drifting off into the abyss with no meaning nor direction.</p>

<p>For a long time, you believed those scars made you broken and you let it define your existence. You questioned your worth, your value, your place in the world. You lived with voices both internal and external, telling you that you weren’t enough. And sometimes, you believed them. So much so that you end up spiraling in an endless cycle of self-sabotage. Other times, the darkness got so loud that it made you believe you were better off gone and you’d cope by going through addictions. Anything to escape the feeling of senselessness and purposelessness.</p>

<p>But here’s the part that matters most. Despite all the punches life threw at you, you kept going. It gave you the hunger for success, the desire to achieve great things, to become powerful. Because not only will you prove the doubters wrong, but you’d also no longer have to wake up being afraid. You want to be feared.</p>

<p>Life didn’t go easy on you. It tested you multiple times. You were faced with insurmountable obstacles and they were too many to count. But each time, you got back up stronger. Whenever you got knocked down, you’d get back up with more grit, more defiance. You’ve been at war for so long that you’ve inevitably become a silent warrior. You might not wear armor and perhaps you might even still cry sometimes. But your strength is real. It’s definitely not loud or performative. It’s forged in silence, in solitude, and in choosing not to give up when no one else is watching. Only you are aware of how much you’ve struggled to come this far.</p>

<p>Maybe you still doubt yourself sometimes.. Maybe you still feel like you’re not far enough, not healed enough, not accomplished enough. That’s okay, just look at everything you’ve survived. Look at how far you’ve come with no map, no guarantees and a shitload of uncertainties. You’ve made it so far with just sheer will and tenacity. You’re fucking unbreakable. Don’t underestimate yourself.</p>

<p>And please, if you’re reading this and life feels heavy again, don’t forget how many times you’ve already saved yourself. When there’s a will, there’s a way. You’ll be fine, you’ll be alright.</p>

<p>You’ve always deserved more than what you were given. What makes you special is the story. Your story. How you learned to build yourself. Your peace, strength, and hope. You made your own blueprint from broken pieces. You have never needed anyone to save you. All you need is yourself to believe in you.</p>

<p>So I hope, wherever you are now, you’re living boldly and freely. I hope you’re happier and loving yourself deeply. Life, afterall is about about the journey and what fun would it be if you didn’t get to experience the ups and downs of it? Oh and one last thing, please don’t ever forget this: You didn’t just survive your traumatic past. You’re in the process of transforming yourself into the kind of person you once needed. And that’s something you can always be proud of, regardless. If life knocks you down, and it will, get back up. Don’t be so hard on yourself. Because as cliche as it sounds, tough times don’t always last. Only tough people do.</p>

<p>With love,</p>

<p>Your past self</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey you, how are you feeling right now, please be honest.

I can’t help but have this gnawing feeling that I’m always responsible for how others feel.</p>

<p>It’s extremely heavy and exhausting. I can’t remember when I started developing this but carrying the emotional weight of everyone around me became a reflex, almost like muscle memory. For years, I can’t help but always scan the room for any discomfort. It’s like a natural gift for attracting tension, I genuinely cannot control it. I would read between the lines of someone’s tone and immediately jump into “I need to fix this” mode. Sometimes, I’d twist myself into knots trying to prevent someone else’s sadness, frustration, or anger…even when I had nothing to do with it. In some cases, my anxious effort to make others feel better can lead to misunderstandings when I say or do the wrong things. I know, it’s pretty ironic.</p>

<p>But here’s what I’m learning: feeling responsible for others’ emotions just means that I may be more compassionate than others. But, at the same time, it makes me hostage to people’s moods. And worse, it deprives them of the space to feel what they need to feel, process it, and grow.</p>

<p>Other people are allowed to be upset. They’re allowed to be disappointed, frustrated, and even mad. But it doesn’t mean I caused it. And even if I did unintentionally, it doesn’t mean I’m obligated to fix it immediately. I’ve been through those feelings myself and I never had the expectation that others should fix it for me.</p>

<p>Boundaries are not walls; they are clarity. They remind me where I should draw the line and where others do too. I can care deeply without carrying the whole load on my shoulders all the time. I can be supportive without self-abandoning. It is not my duty to be a saint and try to fix things. I need to start paying more attention to myself, not towards others.</p>

<p>So if you’re like me, an empath who’s always bracing for emotional impact, maybe this is your reminder too: you’re not responsible for how others feel. You’re only responsible for showing up when things get hard for them. That’s enough, and that’s always been enough.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always been someone who’s emotionally intelligent, an empath who’s constantly at war with her own thoughts.

But why a journaling platform?</p>

<p>From an early age, I always knew I was different from everyone else. I was consciously aware of my own thoughts and feelings. I was not like other kids who had ambitions of being doctors, lawyers or astronauts. At that time I didn’t know there was a name for it, an entrepreneur. But I always thought of creating something that would make an impactful change in our world.</p>

<p>Growing up in a toxic environment didn’t go exactly well with my ambitions. I suffered tremendously from the psychological abuse and my perception about my own abilities deteriorated. I’d wasted time battling mental health issues and fighting addictions when I should’ve been focusing on my dreams.</p>

<p>Then one day, came a benefactor. He knew of my struggles and asked if I’d thought of creating a product around my story. At that moment, everything clicked. My whole life has been centred around watching others and myself struggle with mental health. Yet, with a burning passion to create change, it had never occurred to me that I should build something to fix the problem. A problem that I resonate with and others who were like myself.</p>

<p>I’ve always been reserved about my feelings. I never felt like burdening others with my emotional baggage. So I turned to journaling. It started with a diary when I was 9 and moved to a notes application on my phone. Allowing myself to write about my feelings helped me re-organise them and understand myself better. It was my safe space.</p>

<p>Eventually came the dark age of social media. None were tailored specifically to host a large body of text for journaling. Those were created for people to look glamorous. People only showed you what they wanted you to see. Most people end up developing mental health issues and feel trapped because a judgement-free system has yet to exist. Society started creating unrealistic expectations on just about everything. From the way you look, to the lifestyle you’re living, even to who you’re dating. That itself is enough to create the pressure to be a perfect being. And it made people forget that we’re only human. To be human, is to feel.</p>

<p>Reddit is a good example for people using anonymous profiles to share their feelings in various communities. Most leverage it to vent their thoughts and seek advice or validation from strangers. I myself have turned to Reddit to seek comfort from others who faced similar situations. Some stories have positively impacted me as mine have done for others. It’s the feeling of receiving emotional support and building connections out of your best or worst situations from strangers. It’s the ability to feel seen in a sea of strangers and understanding that you’re not alone. It’s a good system, but people still don’t feel safe. It’s evident because many users begin their post with “I’m using a throw-away account”. This signifies that users don’t feel comfortable enough.</p>

<p>Society has made it sound abnormal to feel a certain way. Reddit simply isn’t built for mental health wellness albeit its anonymity features. Everyone uses it as a journal because they know it’s where everyone else dumps their emotional feelings too. We need a platform that advocates for mental health. To normalize having struggles and help people realise that we are only human. Our feelings matter more than we think and we deserve a safe space to talk about it.</p>

<p>My vision for this journaling platform is to create a safe digital space for people to emotionally connect through journaling. Journaling our thoughts would reveal an unfiltered and raw version of ourselves. Through reading what others might be feeling, it heals the societal belief that everyone is flawless. With our world being digitized today and advancements in technology, this platform can revolutionise the way mental health is being viewed or treated.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to build a journaling platform that helps people with emotional wellness and connection.

My mind churns with anxieties, tangled in thoughts of overdue bills and mounting debts. Each notification of an unpaid bill feels like a heavy weight, pushing me into a corner of vulnerability I’ve never known before. The fear of being unable to meet even basic needs is unsettling and humbling.</p>

<p>Yet, within this unsettling chaos, clarity begins to surface. I am finally seeing the consequences of my actions and the choices I made without fully understanding its severity. Despite the turmoil and suffering I experienced, it feels as though this difficult chapter is shaping me, and the beginning to something better.</p>

<p>For too long, I’ve been trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and negativity. Accepting that I could be loved seemed like an impossible feat, something that’s perhaps reserved exclusively for some others. Maybe these feelings took root the day my father made me feel a sense of abandonment, imprinting a deep sense of void in my soul. But there comes a moment when I must choose to let go of these childhood trauma and step forward. At some point, blaming my predicament on past memories becomes nothing short of an excuse to behave the way I do. It’s excruciatingly exhausting to carry such old pain around every day when all I need to do is simply let go and move on.</p>

<p>It feels as though I’m standing at the lowest point of my life, yet strangely, hope accompanies me through this darkness. Perhaps this is precisely what I needed to experience in order to change. Unexpectedly, it’s in this moment of hopelessness that I’ve come to see that I am deeply loved. Friends have provided unconditional genuine care, stepping up in ways I never expected. My family offers support that feels like an embrace, comforting and reassuring in its sincerity. Reflecting on these moments fills me with immeasurable gratitude and hope that I had forgotten existed.</p>

<p>As I write these words from my bed tonight, those haunting thoughts of despair have begun to slowly fade. I realize that my long-held beliefs about being unloved were unfounded fears rooted in past trauma. No one explicitly told me I didn’t deserve love. I told myself that because I feared rejection. I feared abandonment again. This difficult journey has taught me that love and support surround me, if only I choose to see and accept it. If it takes pain and suffering to acknowledge the fact that I’m loved, I would gladly go through this predicament over and over again. Because that’s the price I’m willing to pay to be let loose from the chains that withheld me from acknowledging love.</p>

<p>All it takes is opening our hearts to the love already present in our lives. It won’t be easy but it will come. We all deserve kindness, compassion, and genuine connections, no matter how deep our struggles might be. Self-hatred is the enemy of joy. We all deserve to love and be loved, don’t forget that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s 12:03 AM and sleep evades me.

Growing up, it was common to hear elders stress the importance of truthfulness. However, honesty wasn’t always simple.</p>

<p>My father was intimidating, and even now, memories of his anger unsettle me. Despite this fear, as a child, I often found myself in trouble. Teachers would call home to report my misbehavior, and inevitably, my father would be waiting, cane in hand. He would stare deeply into my eyes, asking if the accusations were true. Fearful, I’d shake my head, nervously stuttering, “No.”</p>

<p>Even when I thought I’d delivered my most convincing lie, he saw right through it. Each time he caught me lying, he would say firmly, “I hate it when you lie. Look at me and tell me the truth, or you’ll face the consequence.”</p>

<p>So, I adapted. I started telling the truth, believing honesty would grant me leniency. But I was mistaken. Even when truthful, particularly when wrongly accused or misunderstood, I faced punishment just as severe. This harsh reality taught me a painful lesson: honesty doesn’t always protect you from criticism or consequence.</p>

<p>The abusive repercussions of lying to my father had a profound impact. Because he always saw through my deceit, I became convinced that I was simply born to be terrible at lying. Subconsciously, this belief lingered, making lying extraordinarily difficult for me when growing up. Ironically, as I grew older, the fear of hurting others became greater than the fear of getting caught in a lie. Lying eventually became less frightening than allowing those I loved to see the truth about me.</p>

<p>Whenever confronted with admitting my truth, I felt compelled to bend the truth or outright lie. My dishonesty never arose from malicious intent, nor was it ever employed to harm others. Instead, my lies were always about concealing my own wrongdoings. It was always done to protect myself and others. I’d rather carry my burdens alone, despite the mental toll, believing I was sparing those I love from disappointment and shame at discovering just how flawed I truly am.</p>

<p>Each lie told became increasingly harder to manage, for lies inevitably require more lies to sustain them. Over time it gets harder and harder to catch up with them because they’re always made up on the spur of the moment when panic sets in.</p>

<p>“No man has a good enough memory to be a good liar.”</p>

<p>The guilt from lying and the shame of feeling like you’ve failed everyone, including yourself, gnaws at you relentlessly. The constant dread that your lies coming to light is exhausting, like dragging a heavy weight you cannot release till the truth is finally told.</p>

<p>Being self-aware amplifies the agony of lying; the strain on your conscience is immense. Sometimes I wish I was oblivious to the discomfort of deceit. Maybe I wouldn’t be constantly haunted by the guilt that follows.</p>

<p>Lying, in those moments, always felt like a non-negotiable option. You craft false narratives, construct versions of yourself you wish were true. If you must be judged for your mistakes, you prefer it to be perceived as something “less” severe than the reality, because in those brief moments, lying offers temporary relief and makes you feel better. Even though you know it’s wrong..</p>

<p>But here’s an undeniable truth: Lies always surface eventually. And when they do, the erosion of trust cuts deeper than any temporary discomfort honesty might have caused initially. Consider the scenario where your truth might cause no immediate harm to your loved ones, but being caught in a lie or multiple lies later would inflict deeper pain. It creates a barrier for trust. I’ve always known this from the moment I learnt to bury uncomfortable truths. Despite that, whenever I faced such situations, I still instinctively believe that my lies are acts of mercy on myself and the people who I love. Unfortunately, It’s a delusion that only the insecure would buy.</p>

<p>Having said so much, I doubt I was able to encapsulate the true complexity and emotional toll of lying. But one thing is certain: the truth, however painful, will set you free, even if it feels utterly unbearable in the moment. Telling the truth is also a form of acceptance and a sign that you are ready for growth. Am I Ready?</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The value of honesty was instilled in me throughout childhood, not just at home but also in classrooms and by figures of authority.

My childhood felt like being a bird trapped in a cage, constantly yearning for the sky that was always just beyond my reach. Every daydream revolved around the moment I’d finally gather the courage to break free from his grip and experience life on my own terms. I genuinely believed that freedom was the missing piece, the ultimate goal that would finally make life complete. For that freedom, I was willing to pay any price.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found the strength to reclaim my life. I took the leap and fought hard for the freedom I’d longed for. Yet, to my dismay, happiness eluded me. Over the years, the stress and emotional turmoil led me to gain 20 kilograms, as I resorted to binge eating to cope. The weight gain amplified my insecurities, fueling self-loathing and sadness. It might seem trivial to some, but the agony of body dysmorphia is something only those who’ve experienced it, can truly grasp. Again, I convinced myself: if only I could achieve an athlete’s physique, then surely contentment would follow, even if it meant sacrificing some of that hard-earned freedom.</p>

<p>And so, determined, I pushed forward, disciplined myself, and successfully got into shape. Finally, I had both the freedom and the physique others admired. But even then, true peace remained elusive. University began, and with it came overwhelming anxiety about the uncertainty of my future. To escape this anxiety, I fell into another trap,addiction, which quickly led to mounting debt. Life felt like an endless cycle of misery, pulling me back into the same trap. I thought again: if only I were debt-free, then surely I’d find happiness.</p>

<p>But here’s the truth I’ve come to painfully realize: the grass always appears greener until it isn’t. Even if my debt vanished overnight at the cost of my freedom or my health, dissatisfaction would inevitably linger. Real happiness doesn’t spring from external circumstances or the resolution of temporary hardships. True contentment must be cultivated deep within ourselves, nurtured through gratitude and a sincere appreciation for life’s small yet meaningful milestones. Constantly chasing after more only leaves us perpetually empty.</p>

<p>Greed, after all, is a sin,not merely because it makes us endlessly desire more, but because it blinds us to the beauty and abundance we already possess.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I grew up under the shadow of an abusive and controlling father.

The truth is, peace was never something I could reliably expect. Conflict felt more certain than winning the lottery. If you asked me to name a moment from my childhood when I genuinely felt safe or at ease, I’m not sure I could. Each time I dared to catch my breath, another storm was already brewing on the horizon.</p>

<p>At some point, I stopped believing I deserve a simple, peaceful life. My childhood memories became filled with endless loops of tension and turmoil. There was always a feeling of judgment day looming, a heavy, unsettling sensation that prevented me from ever truly feeling like I don’t constantly have weights on my shoulders.</p>

<p>These experiences, imprinted so early, eventually turned peace itself into something frightening, even dangerous. When calm arrived, I’d instinctively brace myself for disaster. Silence didn’t soothe me; it triggered anxiety. Instead of savoring these tranquil moments, I spent them anticipating their inevitable demise. This anxiety was so profound that I couldn’t allow myself to trust in moments of genuine calm. How could I if all I’ve ever known was chaos?</p>

<p>And so began my habit of self-sabotage—a quiet war against my own happiness. I subconsciously learned to disrupt the peace by myself before something else could destroy it. Over time, my body and mind developed an involuntary reflex to push away tranquility. Happiness felt too vulnerable, too uncertain, and too good to be real. Sabotaging myself became my way of maintaining control; if the chaos was self-inflicted, at least it was predictable.</p>

<p>These acts of self-sabotage have inflicted tremendous pains on my healing. It doesn’t help being so aware of myself yet having no way to prevent these habits from reoccurring.  But I want it to stop. I need it to stop.</p>

<p>Looking back clearly at the patterns I’ve carried with me, I’ve begun to wonder if perhaps the bravest thing I could do is to stop fighting against myself. Maybe the real challenge isn’t surviving chaos, but allowing myself the bravery of embracing calm without conditions or skepticism. Perhaps the most powerful rebellion against a painful past isn’t more struggle, but learning how to rest in moments of genuine ease without fearing their end.</p>

<p>I’m slowly realizing that peace doesn’t have to be a fragile, nor a temporary gift; it’s not something reserved for those who’ve earned it through endless suffering. Peace is steady, patient, and always available beneath life’s turbulence, just like a river gently flowing, ready for me to finally trust it enough to let myself drift along its current, without constantly looking ahead for rapids. If I learn to simply embrace the imperfections of life by just being at peace, there wouldn’t be a need for self-sabotage.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always assumed that the older I got, the closer I’d be to the peace I desperately yearned for as a child. The truth is, peace was never something I could reliably expect. Conflict felt more certain than winning the lottery. If you asked me to name a moment from my childhood when I genuinely felt safe or at ease, I’m not sure I could. Each time I dared to catch my breath, another storm was already brewing on the horizon.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Edge of Grief</title><link href="https://hofeiying.com/The-Edge-of-Grief/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Edge of Grief" /><published>2025-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hofeiying.com/The-Edge-of-Grief</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofeiying.com/The-Edge-of-Grief/"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been an emotional person. Someone who’s deeply sentimental, easily moved by small gestures, old photos, and fading memories. Thankfully, I never had to face real loss when I was young. But as I grow older, the thought of grief feels like a shadow that creeps closer with each passing year.</p>

<p>There have been moments where I’ve spiraled into panic attacks, triggered by obsessive thoughts of losing the people I love. These imagined tragedies loop in my mind like a broken record. I know they’re not real, but when they take over, logic disappears. I begin to grieve events that haven’t happened. It feels real and I grieve for a situation that doesn’t exist. And the fear becomes overwhelming: What if one day someone I love is just… gone? How would I survive that?</p>

<p>Not long ago, someone close to me passed away. A friend, but more than that, a steady older brother presence in my life. Someone who looked out for me when I didn’t know I needed looking after. His death came without warning, so sudden and sharp. It cracked something open in me, forcing questions I had been avoiding to surface again.</p>

<p>What is this life? What does it mean to be here, only to vanish? Why does everything feel so temporary, so brittle, so easily lost?</p>

<p>If I could choose my fate, I think I’d rather leave this world before my loved ones. It might sound selfish, but I’d rather be spared the pain of loss than endure the silence that follows it. The truth is harsh: when someone dies, they’re truly gone. People say memories live on, but even they will begin to blur someday. Eventually, the voice you once heard clearly becomes an echo. Photos become symbols. You see, death steals more than just people, it steals the feeling of them.</p>

<p>Everything in life is ephemeral. It is fragile. It can change overnight.</p>

<p>And maybe the only way to cope with this inevitable truth is to stay grounded in the present. To fully appreciate the people I love while they are still here. To be more intentional with my time. More generous with my love. More present in my conversations. I have begun taking more photos, capturing the ordinary, a shared laugh, a quiet meal, a hand held a little longer, because I fear forgetting. I fear the day when remembering is all I have.</p>

<p>I think those who suffer most in grief are the ones with the heaviest regrets. I don’t want to be one of them. If I die tomorrow, I want to be at peace with how I lived. I want to know that I loved fully, gave freely, and didn’t wait for later to be the person I was meant to be for the people I care about.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always been an emotional person.

I had no real control over my impulses. I would get angry and say things recklessly, often hurting the people I loved. It was like when something triggers you and you feel that tingling in the back of your neck. You try to bite your tongue because you know nothing good will come out. A wave of rage passes over you and you black out. Before you know it, you are lashing out verbally and physically. It feels sinfully good to release that pent-up tension. But once the adrenaline fades, guilt rushes in. You reflect on your outburst and realize the problem was never as big as your reaction. That was my reality.</p>

<p>I would also fall into depression for days, making reckless decisions to feel better. I was often erratic. Unstable. I never learned how to deal with what I was feeling. I only knew how to repress it and hope it would go away. But it never did. It got worse. I felt trapped inside my own body. Miserable. Exhausted. Always stuck in fight or flight mode.</p>

<p>When you live like that for long enough, your brain stops thinking clearly. Strong emotions like anger, fear, sadness, or excitement take over. Control shifts from the part that plans and makes good decisions to the part that just reacts. The stronger the emotion, the weaker your ability to think. You stop choosing your actions. You just react.</p>

<p>It was not until recently that I learned there is a strong link between being held captive by your emotions and addiction. When you cannot manage your emotions, you look for something, anything, to escape. For me, it was a serious gambling addiction that lasted five years. I chased the high because it gave me a break from myself, from the world. I could not control my emotions and, as a result, my impulses. That is another story to share someday.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to even realize what was happening. For years, I thought my emotions and impulses were just part of who I was, something I would always be stuck with. But I am starting to see that they are not my identity. They are patterns I can, in fact, change.</p>

<p>Learning to control my emotions instead of being controlled by them is still a work in progress. And I am not going to pretend that I have it all figured out. Some days I still lose control. Some days I still chase the wrong things to avoid feeling what I need to feel. But I am starting to understand that controlling your emotions does not mean you stop feeling them. It means you stop enabling them to decide for you.</p>

<p>It is a slow, painful process. But when I remember to stay present instead of running away, I take back a little more control. I start living instead of just surviving.</p>

<p>I know I am not perfect. I still feel everything, so deeply. But I have grown to be more aware, and I am trying to stay in the driver’s seat, even if my hands are still shaking.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ho Fei Ying</name><email>feistyho17@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing up, I was always held captive by my emotions.
