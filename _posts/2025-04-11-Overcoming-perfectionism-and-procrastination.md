title: Overcoming Perfectionism and Procrastination

My boss often talks about the “get things done” mentality, a philosophy that emphasizes action over perfection. When he first introduced this concept to me, I wasn’t sure if it aligned with my values or approach to work.  

As someone who has always been an overthinker, I’ve long aimed for perfection in everything I do. This mindset stems from my childhood, where I was constantly expected to perform at my absolute best. Over time, this pursuit of perfection led to paralysis and executive dysfunction, as the idea of tackling tasks felt overwhelming unless I could guarantee flawless results. Inevitably, procrastination and unproductivity became recurring issues in my life.  

When my boss explained his approach, I initially resisted the idea. He encouraged me to focus on completing just one task each day, no matter how big or small, and to disregard the rest for the moment. His belief was that having a tangible deliverable by the end of the day meant I was being efficient. At first, I thought this was counterproductive; why settle for mediocrity when I could strive for excellence?  

However, as time passed, his ideology began to resonate with me. I started noticing how much time I wasted obsessing over perfecting my work. Instead of making progress, I often felt stuck and overwhelmed, leaving me with nothing accomplished by the end of the day. This not only made me feel incompetent but also left me frustrated with myself for wasting valuable time and energy.  

The concept became even clearer when my boss sent me to a training program where I encountered Paul Graham’s essay, *Startups in 13 Sentences*. While Graham’s advice is tailored to startups, I realized its principles could easily be applied to everyday life and productivity. Two lines from his essay stood out to me:  

Launch fast. Let your idea evolve. 

These statements encapsulate the essence of taking action without waiting for perfect conditions or overthinking every detail. They emphasize starting somewhere or anywhere, allowing clarity and momentum to build as you move forward. The first step doesn’t need to be flawless; it simply needs to be taken. From there, you can refine your efforts based on what you learn along the way. True progress often comes from adaptability rather than rigidly adhering to an original plan.  

While I’m still working on fully integrating this mindset into my daily life, it has already helped me overcome procrastination and deliver results, even if they’re small steps forward. By focusing on action rather than perfection, I’ve started breaking free from the cycle of paralysis and have found a new sense of productivity and purpose.
