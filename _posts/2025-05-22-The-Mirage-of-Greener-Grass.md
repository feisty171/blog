title: The Mirage of Greener Grass

I grew up under the shadow of an abusive and controlling father. My childhood felt like being a bird trapped in a cage, constantly yearning for the sky that was always just beyond my reach. Every daydream revolved around the moment I'd finally gather the courage to break free from his grip and experience life on my own terms. I genuinely believed that freedom was the missing piece, the ultimate goal that would finally make life complete. For that freedom, I was willing to pay any price.

Eventually, I found the strength to reclaim my life. I took the leap and fought hard for the freedom I'd longed for. Yet, to my dismay, happiness eluded me. Over the years, the stress and emotional turmoil led me to gain 20 kilograms, as I resorted to binge eating to cope. The weight gain amplified my insecurities, fueling self-loathing and sadness. It might seem trivial to some, but the agony of body dysmorphia is something only those who've experienced it, can truly grasp. Again, I convinced myself: if only I could achieve an athleteâ€™s physique, then surely contentment would follow, even if it meant sacrificing some of that hard-earned freedom.

And so, determined, I pushed forward, disciplined myself, and successfully got into shape. Finally, I had both the freedom and the physique others admired. But even then, true peace remained elusive. University began, and with it came overwhelming anxiety about the uncertainty of my future. To escape this anxiety, I fell into another trap,addiction, which quickly led to mounting debt. Life felt like an endless cycle of misery, pulling me back into the same trap. I thought again: if only I were debt-free, then surely I'd find happiness.

But here's the truth I've come to painfully realize: the grass always appears greener until it isn't. Even if my debt vanished overnight at the cost of my freedom or my health, dissatisfaction would inevitably linger. Real happiness doesn't spring from external circumstances or the resolution of temporary hardships. True contentment must be cultivated deep within ourselves, nurtured through gratitude and a sincere appreciation for life's small yet meaningful milestones. Constantly chasing after more only leaves us perpetually empty.

Greed, after all, is a sin,not merely because it makes us endlessly desire more, but because it blinds us to the beauty and abundance we already possess.
